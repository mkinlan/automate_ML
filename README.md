## Automating Spreadsheet Mapping with Machine Learning

Imagine you have a spreadsheet of department information that you download from Corporate every quarter. Your job is to map these departments to specific audit categories and teams. You've been doing this so long that it's second nature. It doesn't take much time; typically there are only a handful of new departments every quarter. Easy peasy!

Is there a way to automate this?

You know that the departments align to regions and teams in a logical way, but you've never actually needed to write out the rules behind this mapping. Could you use machine learning to learn your unwritten mapping rules?
